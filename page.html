            <div class='text col-lg-9 col-sm-12'>
                <p>Every two years, the entire House of Representatives is re-elected. This body of 435 legislators is intended, as the name suggests, to be representative of the American electorate. In 2010, this meant about <a href='http://www.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-data-text.php' target="_blank">700,00 people per representative</a>
                  . Given this seemingly straightforward relationship, one would expect, on average, that the political makeup of the House of Representatives would reflect the political makeup of the US voting population.</p>
                <p>Of course, the relationship isn’t so simple. Representatives in actuality are elected from States, which are then divided into Congressional districts. The determination of the geography of these districts is where gerrymandering enters the picture. <a href='http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gerrymander' target="_blank">Gerrymandering</a>
                   is the process of “dividing of a state [] into election districts so as to give one political party a majority in many districts while concentrating the voting strength of the other party into as few districts as possible".</p>

            <h3>Of course, this is a grossly oversimplified scenario.</h3>
            <p>There is significantly more complexity going into which party gets seats in the House beyond how many votes their party gets nationally.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, it does seem interesting that this disparity generally favors the Republican party. House elections are done by state, and then by district.
                Therefore, to investigate further we can analyze to a further degree of detail and perform a similar analysis on the state level.</p>

                <p>In order to perform this analysis on a state-by-state level, I determined how many "gerrymandered representatives" occurred in each state for each of the past six elections.
                    The number of "gerrymandered representatives" is determined by the difference between predicted number representatives of each party based on popular vote and the actual number of representative for each party.</p>
                <p>For example, in Alabama's 2004 elections for the House, about 40% of the votes went to Democratic candidates, and about 60% went to Republican candidates.
                    Therefore, the expected number of Democratic representatives out of a total of 7 would be approximately 3. However, in actuality only 2 of Alabama's 7 representatives were Democrats that year,
                    so one representative (or about 14% of representatives) were "gerrymandered representatives," favoring the Republican party in this case.</p>
                <p>Following this procedure for all states for the past six elections, we see the following, with average proportions of "gerrymandered representatives" for each state:</p>

                <p>Gerrymandering is to some degree in the interests of both parties, regardless of whether they’re in power. <a href='http://www.redistrictingthenation.com/whatis-who.aspx' target="_blank">The redrawing of districts</a> is generally determined by whichever party is the majority in the State legislature or holds the Governorship
                  , and therefore is a highly politicized process. The interests in this process differ for the party as a whole versus an individual representative:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>For the parties, the goal is to maximize the number of seats they hold and minimize the seats for the opposition party. This means that the optimal strategy is to place as many of the opposing party’s voters in as few districts as possible, resulting in few districts that are won by a large margin. Then,
                    they would like to create many districts won by their own party, but by a lesser (but still comfortable) margin.</li>
                  <br />
                  <li>For the individual representatives, we might cynically assume their only interest is to stay elected in their district. Therefore, they would be glad to be placed in a district with a very high probability of their party’s win. Oddly enough, this means that a Congressperson from one party could encourage
                    the redrawing of their district in a way that the opposing party that is in control would also like.</li>

                <p>You may very well wonder if the drawing of districts will automatically benefit Republicans, given that Democratic voters are very often concentrated in urban areas.
                    While this may be the case in areas where the drawing of districts is not a politicized process, there is <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/09/24/1423801/-This-map-shows-why-Republicans-have-a-lock-on-the-House-They-drew-the-lines" target="_blank">
                    significant evidence</a> that a large number of congressional districts are drawn by Republicans. Therefore, there surely is a large strategic component above and beyond any structural factors.</p>

            <div class='text col-lg-9 col-sm-12'>
                <p><span class="emphasis">Legislative Gridlock:</span> One would expect that since every seat in the House of Representatives goes up for election every two years, there would be tremendous potential for political upheavals. But that really isn't the case. In the 2016 election, it is nearly unthinkable that Democrats will
                win back the House. The power of incumbency is certainly a factor here, but even more important is the structural inflexibility manufactured by gerrymandering.</p>
                <p>The result is that even if Democrats were to perform very well nationally, taking the presidency and the Senate, it is very unlikely that any significant legislative
                    change would be allowed, given the Republican control of the House.</p>
                <br />
                <p><span class="emphasis">Effective Disenfranchisement:</span> The Republican dominance in gerrymandering effectively disenfranchises many Democratic voters. The vote of a Democrat in a district that has been gerrymandered to be very highly Democrat-leaning is effectively useless on the margin; as is the vote of one
                    who is in a district designed for a moderate margin Republican victory. Nonpartisan districts or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation" target="_blank">
                    alternative forms of representation</a> would mean that every vote truly does matter.</p>
                <br />
                <p><span class="emphasis">Political Polarization:</span> When a district is gerrymandered to strongly favor one party over another, representatives are strongly incentivized to take on more and more extreme views that favor their base of voters.
                    Any representatives who favor cooperation with the other party or centrism can effectively be challenged in primary battles. This phenomenon exists for both parties, but can most clearly be seen with the rise of Tea Party Republicans.</p>
